Todo:
  game:    
    create the rest of the units
    make multiplayer work:
      mine:
        unit.mine = false; // set to true on all my units
        getMyUnits() // in case player has multiple roles
        only display your assets
      wait for incoming moves:
        newMove(): check if contains "<command>" from player, wait for all players
      
      
    submit units as you place them, record them on the other side (so people can see the planned next move)
      <place unit="" region="" />
    auto-advance situation report slider
    ability to place 2 units in same square:
      click on unit causes pass-through to the square behind (look at minesweepers)
    timeout clock (steal from word-morph)
      auto-submit if not clicked
    chat
    
  opening:
    find a cool font for the instructions
    do the fade-in stuff
    reward for watching story
    skip story
    rewards for watching rules for each player type
    skip instructions

  end:
    click for where scuds are (place them on map as avatars)
    survey for certainty
    show results/airstrikes

Sensors:
  0 Recon Satellite - Column -- Hi probability 0 or ? (can't reliably confirm launchers) <satellite>
  1 Manned Aircraft - Row, every other turn -- Row E: excellent reliability C, D reduced <SR-71> 
  2 UAV - Row - Good search reliability - chance of shot down, random probability of replacement <
  3 SIGINT - 1 square - Search any grid square - 0 or ?
  4 HUMINT - 1 square - Walk around - chance of execution, unreplacable
  5 Spec Ops - distinguish ? and x - compromised: emergency extraction, loss for 1 turn, chance of added back every additional turn
  6 Navy SEALS - Spec ops starting on Row E
