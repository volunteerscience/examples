The purpose of the python programs is to create solutions.txt, which has a format like this:

3;tun,gun,guy
...
10;sky,say,pay,pal,pel,eel,ell,elm,olm,ohm

The input file of all english words is wn-data-eng.tab.
generate a list of valid three letter words:
  python extract_three.py > valid.txt

manually generate vulgar.txt

generate_problems.py uses valid.txt and vulgar.txt to generate solutions.txt


to see the rejected words:
diff all.tre valid.tre | egrep "^<" > reject.txt

note:
generate_problems.py requires networkx:
  easy_install networkx
  
  
Word morph. A navigation game in which players are given two three-letter words and asked to find a sequence of words that connects them where the intermediate words only vary by a single letter from the predecessor. Manipulations include selecting word combinations based on difficulty (distance on the graph, flow through central words, etc.) as well as exploration-exploitation designs that expose users to either others’ proposed path lengths or the paths themselves.
