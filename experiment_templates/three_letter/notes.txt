The purpose of the python programs is to create solutions.txt, which has a format like this:

3;tun,gun,guy
...
10;sky,say,pay,pal,pel,eel,ell,elm,olm,ohm

The input file of all english words is wn-data-eng.tab.
generate a list of valid three letter words:
  python extract_three.py > valid.txt

manually generate vulgar.txt

generate_problems.py uses valid.txt and vulgar.txt to generate solutions.txt


to see the rejected words:
diff all.tre valid.tre | egrep "^<" > reject.txt

note:
generate_problems.py requires networkx:
  easy_install networkx
