<p>You can set the parameters of the deviant bot by defining the variables <b>bot1</b>, <b>bot2</b>, etc ... and set it to 
  <pre>[7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]</pre> etc and it will swap that many cities from optimal at each round.  
  If there are more rounds, then it will continue to use the last one.  Deactivate them by setting them blank.</p>
