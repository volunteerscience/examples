		Robert Guion, a prominent local businessman was found dead behind his Crestview home this morning. Detective Lt. Mark Moody of the Hilltown precinct reported that Mr. Guion had apparently been assaulted when leaving his home to play golf early this morning. He was struck on the head over the left eye and fell down a flight of stairs leading from a second story deck at the rear of the house. The preliminary coroner's report concluded that death was cause by injuries sustained from the fall and not from the blow to the head. The report estimated that Mr. Guion's death occurred between 6:30 and 7:00 AM. Lt. Moody would neither confirm nor deny rumors that Mr. Guion had been robbed. "We're following all leads. That's all I have to say for now," said Lt. Moody. [From an article in the weekend edition of the local paper, the Valley Sentinel.]

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Billy Prentice

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Rick Rooney (R.R.), Guion's and Malone's Golf Partner

Lt. M.:    I'd like to ask some questions about Mickey Malone.
R. R.:    I'll be glad to help if I can.
Lt. M.:    You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning, correct?
R. R.:    Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.
Lt. M.:    Can you tell me anything about his relationship with Mr. Guion?
R. R.:    They were always good friends until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn't say a whole lot about it, though.  They've had problems in the past, but it's never been this bad.
Lt. M.:    Ok, I appreciate your help.

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular?
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion - Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    Well, I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the racetrack.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had quite a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us just then and seemed really nervous and quickly walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  Thanks for your patience.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice - 2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.
Sg. C.:    Okay, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular?
Lt. M:    Nothing out of the ordinary happened before she left?
S. N.:    Well, maybe... I didn't know there was a problem until I overheard them arguing in his office.  I didn't mean to hear, but I couldn't help it.  I was going in the talk to Mr. Guion about something.  Next thing I knew she was leaving... I mean leaving for good, packing up her things.
Lt. M:    Did you hear what they were arguing about?
S. N.:    No, they sounded real mad, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.  They stopped when they saw me coming.
Lt. M:    Had they argued like that before?
S. N.:    No, not that I know of.  They always seemed to get along real well.  Maybe it was...well, I don't know.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice claims that he came by on Friday to ask your husband for an advance.  Do you know anything about this?
Ms. G:    Yes, he did come by.  Sometime in the afternoon, I believe.
Lt. M:    Did your husband give him any money?
Ms. G:    Yes, he did.  I'm not sure how much, but I remember he said, kind of jokingly, "I wonder if I'll ever get to pay Billy AFTER he does the work."
Lt. M:    Do you know exactly what time it was on Friday when he came by?
Ms. G:    No, I'd only be guessing.  Sometime in the late afternoon.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    Well, I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the racetrack.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had quite a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us just then and seemed really nervous and quickly walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  Thanks for your patience.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.
Sg. C.:    Okay, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Billy Prentice

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Lt. M.:    You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning, correct?
R. R.:    Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.

R. R.:    They were always good friends until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn't say a whole lot about it, though.  They've had problems in the past, but it's never been this bad.
Lt. M.:    Ok, I appreciate your help.

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What time did you find the wallet?
D. D.:    Probably about 7am.  I remember because I got to the store just before 7 and was checking some stock in the back room right before I found the wallet.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Sam Nietzel

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion   Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the track.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us and seemed really nervous and walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    One other matter: Is it true that Eddie Sullivan has a hearing problem?
Ms. G:    Yes, he is very hard of hearing.  Sometimes when he gets a phone call, I have to call him.  I've tried calling him from the deck, but he never hears me.  I have to walk up to him before I get his attention.
Lt. M:    Doesn't he have a hearing aid?
Ms. G:    He has one, but he doesn't wear it while he is working.  He says that it doesn't fit well.  It's one of those tiny ones and he's afraid he will lose it.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Where did you see it?
B. P.:    It was lying in front of the garage door, the side door where I get the mower out.  I remember moving it to the side so I could get the mower out.
Sg. C:    That's all?  You just moved it over to the side?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.
Sg. C.:    Okay, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Billy Prentice

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Rick Rooney (R.R.), Guion's and Malone's Golf Partner

Lt. M.:    I'd like to ask some questions about Mickey Malone.
R. R.:    I'll be glad to help if I can.
Lt. M.:    You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning, correct?
R. R.:    Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.
Lt. M.:    Can you tell me anything about his relationship with Mr. Guion?
R. R.:    They were always good friends until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn't say a whole lot about it, though.  They've had problems in the past, but it's never been this bad.
Lt. M.:    Ok, I appreciate your help.

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What time did you find the wallet?
D. D.:    Probably about 7am.  I remember because I got to the store just before 7 and was checking some stock in the back room right before I found the wallet.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Sam Nietzel

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion   Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the track.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us and seemed really nervous and walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    One other matter: Is it true that Eddie Sullivan has a hearing problem?
Ms. G:    Yes, he is very hard of hearing.  Sometimes when he gets a phone call, I have to call him.  I've tried calling him from the deck, but he never hears me.  I have to walk up to him before I get his attention.
Lt. M:    Doesn't he have a hearing aid?
Ms. G:    He has one, but he doesn't wear it while he is working.  He says that it doesn't fit well.  It's one of those tiny ones and he's afraid he will lose it.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Where did you see it?
B. P.:    It was lying in front of the garage door, the side door where I get the mower out.  I remember moving it to the side so I could get the mower out.
Sg. C:    That's all?  You just moved it over to the side?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Lt. M.:    I'd like to ask some questions about Mickey Malone.
R. R.:    I'll be glad to help if I can.
Lt. M.:    You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning, correct?
R. R.:    Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.
Lt. M.:    Can you tell me anything about his relationship with Mr. Guion?
R. R.:    They were always good friends until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn't say a whole lot about it, though.  They've had problems in the past, but it's never been this bad.
Lt. M.:    Ok, I appreciate your help.

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center
Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Sam Nietzel

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular?
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion   Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    Well, I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the racetrack.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had quite a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us just then and seemed really nervous and quickly walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  Thanks for your patience.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.

Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Billy Prentice

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Lt. M.:    I'd like to ask some questions about Mickey Malone.
R. R.:    I'll be glad to help if I can.
Lt. M.:    You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning, correct?
R. R.:    Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.
Lt. M.:    Can you tell me anything about his relationship with Mr. Guion?
R. R.:    They were always good friends until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn't say a whole lot about it, though.  They've had problems in the past, but it's never been this bad.
Lt. M.:    What time did Mr. Malone arrive at the golf course last Saturday?

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Sam Nietzel

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular?
Lt. M:    Nothing out of the ordinary happened before she left?
S. N.:    Well, maybe... I didn't know there was a problem until I overheard them arguing in his office.  I didn't mean to hear, but I couldn't help it.  I was going in the talk to Mr. Guion about something.  Next thing I knew she was leaving... I mean leaving for good, packing up her things.
Lt. M:    Did you hear what they were arguing about?
S. N.:    No, they sounded real mad, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.  They stopped when they saw me coming.
Lt. M:    Had they argued like that before?
S. N.:    No, not that I know of.  They always seemed to get along real well.  Maybe it was...well, I don't know.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion   Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice claims that he came by on Friday to ask your husband for an advance.  Do you know anything about this?
Ms. G:    Yes, he did come by.  Sometime in the afternoon, I believe.
Lt. M:    Did your husband give him any money?
Ms. G:    Yes, he did.  I'm not sure how much, but I remember he said, kind of jokingly, "I wonder if I'll ever get to pay Billy AFTER he does the work."
Lt. M:    Do you know exactly what time it was on Friday when he came by?
Ms. G:    No, I'd only be guessing.  Sometime in the late afternoon.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    Well, I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the racetrack.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had quite a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us just then and seemed really nervous and quickly walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  Thanks for your patience.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Billy Prentice

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave's Quick Stop

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What time did you find the wallet?
D. D.:    Probably about 7am.  I remember because I got to the store just before 7 and was checking some stock in the back room right before I found the wallet.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.
Sg. C:    Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, please call me.

Sam Nietzel

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.
S. N.:    I'm glad to be I just want to get this mess sorted out.

Marion Guion   Second Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the track.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us and seemed really nervous and walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    One other matter: Is it true that Eddie Sullivan has a hearing problem?
Ms. G:    Yes, he is very hard of hearing.  Sometimes when he gets a phone call, I have to call him.  I've tried calling him from the deck, but he never hears me.  I have to walk up to him before I get his attention.
Lt. M:    Doesn't he have a hearing aid?
Ms. G:    He has one, but he doesn't wear it while he is working.  He says that it doesn't fit well.  It's one of those tiny ones and he's afraid he will lose it.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Where did you see it?
B. P.:    It was lying in front of the garage door, the side door where I get the mower out.  I remember moving it to the side so I could get the mower out.
Sg. C:    That's all?  You just moved it over to the side?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.
Sg. C.:    Okay, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.

Marion Guion

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Mrs. Guion, I know this isn't going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.
Ms. G:    It's OK.  It has to be done and please call me Marion.
Lt. M:    Okay Marion, tell me what you remember from Saturday morning.
Ms. G:    Well, I always sleep in on Saturdays.  I got up around 9 or 9:15am and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10am.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.
Lt. M:    That was about 10:30?
Ms. G:    Yes, I think so...  I'm not absolutely sure.
Lt. M:    You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?
Ms. G:    Yes, I'm fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it's on every morning from 9:30 to 10am.
Lt. M:    So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?
Ms. G:    He didn't actually tell me that it was Bob... not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance.   I remember feeling scared, but it didn't occur to me that it might be Bob.
Lt. M:    This was the first that you knew that something had happened?
Ms. G:    Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn't return until 11 or so.  I thought he was at the country club.
Lt. M:    You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn't telling you everything?
Ms. G:    Not really... I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie's voice.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?
Ms. G:    No, I'm not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study.  It is across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside...so it must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices or a voice shouting... I'm not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.
Lt. M:    Where is the bedroom located?
Ms. G:    At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I thought maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he's leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn't see anything.
Lt. M:    Can you see the deck from your window?
Ms. G:    No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, "Bob is usually gone by now."  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn't see anyone.
Lt. M:    Did you think it was a car leaving?
Ms. G:    Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob's pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.
Lt. M:    Can you see under the carport from the study window?
Ms. G:    Oh yes, I can see under it completely.
Lt. M:    So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?
Ms. G:    That's right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident." Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.
Lt. M:    So what did you do?
Ms. G:    I called for an ambulance like he said, then I went out on the deck (bursts into tears).
Lt. M:    I know that this is hard Marion, but we're just about through.
Ms. G:    I can't go on.
Lt. M:    I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It's very important... now when did you realize that it was your husband?
Ms. G:    When I got out on the deck, I looked down over the railing.  I was stunned.  Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was... gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn't stand looking at him.  I went back inside and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.
Lt. M:    Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?
Ms. G:    Yes, he always does.
Lt. M:    Did he carry a lot of money?
Ms. G:    Not a large amount.  Usually he carries no more than $50.
Lt. M:    Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, go ahead.
Lt. M:    Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.
[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:    Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion's about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.
Ed. S:     Yeah, I got there around 6am.  The sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.
Sg. C:    Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?
Ed. S:     No. The light was on in Mr. Guion's study, but that wasn't unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn't given to him.
Sg. C:    How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S:     I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it lying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around... that's when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy Prentice he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He's always there bright and early and I thought maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn't think he was even there 'cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back until about noon.
Sg. C:    Okay, so you ran over to Mr. Guion...then what happened?
Ed. S:     Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad.  There was blood on his head and he was laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I thought I shouldn't alarm her too much so I just said, "Call an ambulance.  There's been an accident."  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, "It's alright, just call the ambulance."  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn't know he was dead until I got back down the stairs.
Sg. C:    Did you ever find the crowbar?
Ed. S:     What?... Oh... no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn't even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time, Mrs. Guions' sister and her husband were there and I didn't figure that I could do anything.
Sg. C:    You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?
Ed. S:     You know I don't know... Come to think of it, his car wasn't there and none of the yard tools  or the lawn mower were out.   But I thought I heard his station wagon earlier.  
Sg. C:    When was that?
Ed. S:     I can't say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, "That's Billy."  None of Guion's cars would ever sound like that.  I guess it was around 7am.
Sg. C:    Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?
Ed. S:     No, can't say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a distance from the house... probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there are trees between there too.
Sg. C:    You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?
Ed. S:     It was in the carport beside Guion's pickup.
Sg. C:    Why didn't you drive it down to the barn where you were working?
Ed. S:     Well... it had rained the night before, and I didn't want to get it stuck down there.  There's a gravel path but it's not wide enough.  Besides, Mr. Guion didn't want me making ruts in the grass.
Sg. C:    Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, I always like him... He was real fair when it came to business, paid well, and was easy to work for.
Sg. C:    Your daughter worked at Guion's car dealership, didn't she?  Did they get along?
Ed. S:     Yeah, she was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn't ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that it was their business.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C:    Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I'll be in touch.

Mickey Malone

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  It is well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.
M. M.:    We had some differences.
Lt. M:     Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?
M. M.:    Yes
Lt. M:     Why?
M. M.:    Well, we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings a foursome, you know.  Well, the last 2 weeks things had been awkward and downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn't fair to the others.  We would ruin their golf.
Lt. M:     The other 2 being Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend?
M. M.:    Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.
Lt. M:     You play at Mountain View?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?
M. M.:    Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, "If you're playing golf, I'm not!"  He said, "Fine, do what you want."
Lt. M:     What did you do?
M. M.:    My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, "This is silly.  We'll just end up fighting."  I turned back and stopped at a coffee shop across from Eastwood on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just 'cause Bob wanted to be like that didn't mean it had to ruin my day.
Lt. M:     What time did you leave home?
M. M.:    6:20, maybe 6:30... I don't know... somewhere around then.
Lt. M:     How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?
M. M.:    I don't know, it's about a mile north of Meadowland, so that's about 9 miles total.  It probably takes 15 minutes or so.
Lt. M:     How long were you at the cafe?
M. M.:    I don't recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?
Lt. M:     Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don't know what happened last Saturday morning but it is clear that there was foul play.  We are following all leads right now.  If you don't want to answer my questions, you don't have to... at least, not right now.
M. M.:    I really don't know.  I think I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left so maybe 10 minutes.
Lt. M:     You went to the golf course straight from the cafe?
M. M.:    Right.
Lt. M:     It's about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M:     So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30, drove fifteen minutes to Crestview; a couple of minutes back to the cafe, 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking, and another 8 minutes to Mountain View. Let's see... That should put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?
M. M.:    Sounds right...yeah, I got there right at 7; that's when we always meet.
Lt. M:     You did not go to Guion's place on Saturday morning?
M. M.:    No, I didn't.
Lt. M:     Thank you for your time.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion's Yardman

Lt. M:    Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion's death.  You did hear about it didn't you?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn't it?
Lt. M:    Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion's place on Saturday morning?
B. P.:    No, sir.
Lt. M:    Don't you usually cut the grass on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.  I usually do, but not last Saturday.
Lt. M:    Why not?
B. P.:    Well, I just cut it the week before.
Lt. M:    But this time of year, don't you usually cut it every week?
B. P.:    Yeah, but ... I wasn't feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides, it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.
Lt. M:    But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn't it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?
B. P.:    I guess so, but by then I figured I wouldn't have time to get it done before my ball game.
Lt. M:    Billy, what time was your ball game?
B. P.:    Noon.
Lt. M:    How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?
B. P.:    A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.
Lt. M:    Couldn't you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?
B. P.:    I suppose so... l don't know.  I like to get to the game early.  Besides, I said I wasn't feeling so good in the morning.
Lt. M:    Billy, I should tell you right out... Mr. Sullivan... You know Mr. Sullivan don't you?
B. P.:    You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.
Lt. M:    Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion's on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?
B. P.:    How'd he know it was my car?  When?
Lt. M:    He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
B. P.:    No, he couldn't have.  I wasn't there at 7 on Saturday.
Lt. M:    Billy, come on.  We know that your car was at Guion's place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren't a week old.
B. P.:    Okay, Okay, I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.
Lt. M:    What time on Friday?
B. P.:    Around 4:00am, it was just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.
Lt. M:    So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?
B. P.:    Yeah, I suppose so.  I need it for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.
Lt. M:    Okay, Billy, that's all for now.  We'll talk later.
B. P.:    Sir, you know I didn't hit Mr. Guion. You know I wouldn't hurt him he was always good to me.
Lt. M:    Sure, Billy, I know... See you around.

In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:    Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?
D. D.:    It was lying beside the dumpster in the back, right next to some boxes that I had put out there.
Sg. C:    What did the wallet look like?
D. D.:    It was a nice one.  It looked new and expensive, so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.
Sg. C:    Did it have any money in it?
D. D.:    No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion's credit cards inside the dumpster.
Sg. C:    You never found any money or a driver's license?
D. D.:    No, just 3 credit cards.
Sg. C:    What time did you find the wallet?
D. D.:    Probably about 7am.  I remember because I got to the store just before 7 and was checking some stock in the back room right before I found the wallet.
Sg. C:    What made you go outside?
D. D.:    I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That's when I saw the wallet.
Sg. C:    Are you sure the wallet wasn't there earlier?
D. D.:    Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don't know how I would have missed it if it was there.

Excerpts from
Lt. Moody's (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:    Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion's connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?
S. N.:    Yes, I suppose so.  We've done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.
Lt. M:    I've heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.
S. N.:    Yes, that's right; they've been friends since way back.  They have had their ups and downs.  They always worked things out before... until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.
Lt. M:    What was wrong with the parts?
S. N.:    Well, some of them didn't fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or aftermarket parts.
Lt. M:    When did you realize this was going on?
S. N.:    About 2 months ago... It's been a mess around here since.
Lt. M:    So would you like to go back to MM Parts?
S. N.:    No, and I especially wouldn't do it without Mr. Guion's okay.  He was dead set against it.. He wouldn't even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.
Lt. M:    Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan's leaving the firm?
S. N.:    That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?
Lt. M:    Yes, Sue Sullivan.
S. N.:    No, I don't really know anything in particular.
Lt. M:    Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?
S. N.:    Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, "The customer is always right!"  He not only said it, he lived by it.
Lt. M:    Thanks for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You've been a great help.

Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:    Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don't mind.
Ms. G:    Sure.
Lt. M:    Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow or ask for advances on his wages often?
Ms. G:    Yes, quite often.
Lt. M:    Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?
Ms. G:    Well, I'm not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.
Lt. M:    What made you say that?
Ms. G:    I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the track.  We've only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they're beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us and seemed really nervous and walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.
Lt. M:    How long ago did this happen?
Ms. G:    It was soon after he started working for us.  It probably occurred 2 years ago.
Lt. M:    One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?
Ms. G:    No, I can't say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn't show up to mow the lawn.
Lt. M:    Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?
Ms. G:    No, I don't think so.  Melissa, Mickey's wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.
Lt. M:    They didn't come over at any time?
Ms. G:    Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.
Lt. M:    One other matter: Is it true that Eddie Sullivan has a hearing problem?
Ms. G:    Yes, he is very hard of hearing.  Sometimes when he gets a phone call, I have to call him.  I've tried calling him from the deck, but he never hears me.  I have to walk up to him before I get his attention.
Lt. M:    Doesn't he have a hearing aid?
Ms. G:    He has one, but he doesn't wear it while he is working.  He says that it doesn't fit well.  It's one of those tiny ones and he's afraid he will lose it.
Lt. M:    I think that's all, Marion.  I hope I don't have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion's Yardman

Sg. C:    Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you Billy that you don't have to answer my questions if you don't want to.
B. P.:    Sir, I don't mind.  I have nothing to hide.
Sg. C:    Very well.  You said that you went to Guion's on Friday night, not Saturday morning, right?
B. P.:    Yes Sir... Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.
Sg. C:    To borrow some money, I think you said.
B. P.:    Yes, that's right.
Sg. C:    Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?
B. P.:    No! No, sir!
Sg. C:    Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?
B. P.:    No!  I mean...well, I gamble as much as the next guy.  You know, I play poker with the boys and go down to the racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I've really cut down.  I don't have a problem with it sir... really!
Sg. C:    Okay, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
T Sg. C:    Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about... Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night's rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.
B. P.:    But... [long pause]... I...
Sg. C:    Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?
B. P.:    Alright, sir... I was there... I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I went over to him.  It was awful.
Sg. C:    Billy, why didn't you say something before?
B. P.:    Nobody's going to believe me.  I thought I'd just better get out of there and act like I didn't know nothing.
Sg. C:    So you ran.
B. P.:    I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan's truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I swerved that's probably when I went off the road.
Sg. C:    While you were at Guion's did you see a crowbar?
B. P.:    What?  A crowbar? [long pause] Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Sg. C:    Where did you see it?
B. P.:    It was lying in front of the garage door, the side door where I get the mower out.  I remember moving it to the side so I could get the mower out.
Sg. C:    That's all?  You just moved it over to the side?
B. P.:    Yes, sir.
Sg. C:    Anything else you remember about that?
B. P.:    Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan's 'cause Mr. Guion didn't have any tools to speak of around the place other than some garden tools.  But then I thought that it was odd 'cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he's not around.  And I didn't see him anywhere.  All I saw was his truck.
Sg. C:    Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?
B. P.:    No, Sarg, I swear!  I did pick it up and move it, but why would I throw it in the bushes?
Sg. C:    That's what I'd like to know...Okay, let's go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion's on Saturday?
B. P.:    I don't rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I'd guess.  Like I said, I wasn't feeling so good.
Sg. C:    Did you take Mr. Guion's wallet?
B. P.:    No, sir.  You have to believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just got out of there!
Sg. C:    How did you know that he was dead?
B. P.:    I don't know... He looked dead and he didn't move when I yelled... Also, he wasn't lying there natural like.
Sg. C:    Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn't you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?
B. P.:    No, I just got out of there.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.
Sg. C:    Okay, thanks Billy.  That'll be all for now.

Eddie Sullivan   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini's (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:    Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion's garage.  At least, we think it's yours: it has "ES" stamped on it.
Ed. S.:    Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can't be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they're yours.  You know what I mean?
Sg. C.:    Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?
Ed. S.:    No... I can't say as I do.
Sg. C.:    We're trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion's about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion's body?
Ed. S.:    I'm not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don't remember.
Sg. C.:    Okay, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone   2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood's (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:    Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion's house to talk to him.
M. M.:    That's right.
Lt. M.:    But you never actually went to his place, and instead you stopped for coffee.
M. M.:    Yes.
Lt. M.:    So you were at the cafe about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.
M. M.:    Yeah.
Lt. M.:    You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion because you wanted to clear things up.
M. M.:    That's right, but he's been so hard headed.
Lt. M.:    Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?
M. M.:    My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn't my doing.
Lt. M.:    Did he write this note to you?
M. M.:    Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  If I lost the business, I don't know what I would do.  He can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just thought it was time to work this out, one on one.
Lt. M.:    When did you receive the note?
M. M.:    A week ago on Monday, I think.
Lt. M.:    I see.  Okay, Mr. Malone, that's all for now.
